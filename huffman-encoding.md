## Getting started

In this seminar session we will look at different ways to represent
data, using lists, trees and tuples to find the best representation. The
<span>*best representation*</span> could of course mean many things, we
might need a representation that gives us efficient code or we might
want a representation that is easy to explain, implement and maintain.
We will start by using quite simple representations and then refine them
to gain better performance.
