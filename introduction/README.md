# Introduction

To get started you should install Elexir and choose an editor that you wan to use in the development of your programs. In the beginning you will only do small programs so it is not very important that you have an advanced environment for code development - you do however need an editor with support for Elixir syntax. Compiling firles etc can be done from the Elixir shell.
